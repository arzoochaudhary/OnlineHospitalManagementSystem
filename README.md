# OnlineHospitalManagementSystem
There are three modules in the Online Hospital Management System.
1)Patients
2)Doctor
3)Admin
I have created Doctorâ€™s module. So here are the functionalitie of this module.
step 1: Login using registered email address and password.
        If doctor has forgot the password, he/she can click on forgot password.
        By entering phone number and email he/she can reset the password.
step 2: After successful login, Doctor can 
        update profile.
        can add new patients.
        can view appointments/my appointments.
        can change password.
        can logout from the system.
