# OnlineHospitalManagementSystem
There are three modules in the Online Hospital Management System. <br />
1)Patients<br />
2)Doctor<br />
3)Admin<br />
I have created Doctorâ€™s module. So here are the functionalitie of this module.<br />
step 1: Login using registered email address and password.<br />
      <t />  If doctor has forgot the password, he/she can click on forgot password.<br />
        By entering phone number and email he/she can reset the password.<br />
step 2: After successful login, Doctor can <br />
        update profile.<br />
        can add new patients.<br />
        can view appointments/my appointments.<br />
        can change password.<br />
        can logout from the system.<br />
